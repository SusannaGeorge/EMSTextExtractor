I have a two year old male with about a ten foot fall, he pushed the screen out and fell on to the driveway below. Patient appears to have no injury at all, patient is alert, oriented. Patient seems to have some abrasions but there was no loss of consciousness.
This patient has a blood pressure of 124 over 65, he has a pulse rate of 93, his pupils are equal and reactive, and again he's alert and oriented. Patient never lost consciousness. Given the height of the fall, Children's will take the patient as a trauma. What type of surface did the patient fall on to?
Concrete driveway and mulch bedding.
