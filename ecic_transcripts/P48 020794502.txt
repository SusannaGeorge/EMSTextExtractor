A 12 year old male that’s been struck by a car.
On the scene. it’s a 12 year old male, with no medical history. Has had no loss of consciousness. doing my assessment right now. I’m looking at a broken right forearm and a broken left, let’s say knee or right above the knee. We’ve got, some deformity there. patient is alert and oriented and he has a good airway. No trouble breathing. in the torso he has no injuries, abdomen is soft and non-tender. hips are intact, no pain. He has good pulses throughout. vital signs: he’s got a heart rate of 77, pulse ox 100, and last BP 124 over 86.
Are you consent for a femur fracture?
That is a possibility.
