A seven year old female versus a bike. Possible LOC. Right now she’s conscious but a little sluggish according to the units on the scene. Her blood pressure is 110 over 78, heart rate 100, respiration 20. She’s fully immobilized, and we have her on high-flow O-2. they say she has a contusion in the back of her…behind her ear, and she’s a little groggy, verbatim.
