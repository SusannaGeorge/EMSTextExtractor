A four year old male, with a house fire. he's got positive respiratory burns. Alert and oriented at this time. Taching in the 150's. Got capnography reading is 40... 46. let me see, he's alert and conscious. I'm unable to establish an IV at this time. There's no skin burns. All going to be respiratory. I've got soot around the nose and the mouth. the mouth doesn't look too bad. I'm not sure how bad the nose is going to be burned. 
He's taking in air. He's awake and talking to us. He's 100% O-2 at this time. Like I said, he's taching in the 150's, capnography's 43, pulse-ox is, I believe 94, but I've lost the probe.
