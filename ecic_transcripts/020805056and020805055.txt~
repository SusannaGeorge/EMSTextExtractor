Two patients, and a parent. Patient nber one is going to be a Category B trauma. She is four years old, and she was in a car seat in the middle row, left side, of a vehicle that was involved in a high speed crash that involved a Priority 4 patient in the opposing vehicle. Unfortunately, I don't have much information for you other than she is responsive, although she does have a large hemotoma under one of the orbits of her eye. She is awake and responding what seems to be appropriately, although we don't know much else other than she was in the car at the time of the collision. Patient nber two is a Priority Three patient check-up; he was in a booster seat with a harness system on the right side of the same row. He's got some seatbelt abrasions to his shoulder. he is six years old. Alert and oriented and acting appropriately. The abrasions are primarily the only thing we find on secondary survey. The father of these two children are accompanying the patients in Ambulance 728, their ETA to your location is going to be probably about 25 or 30 minutes. They should consult with you when they get an opportunity on the way down the road. If any updates on patient nber one. Just FYI, these two children's mother is going down in a separate unit to MedStar as a Priority 2 rule out trauma. 
The Priority 4 patient was in the opposing vehicle. it was a T-Bone incident that caused the fatality, and, they were all in the vehicle that was not T-boned. They were in the striking vehicle. 
was there any extrication, also? No, they were all easily pulled from the vehicle, and were all in their carseats at the time.
