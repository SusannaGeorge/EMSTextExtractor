A 3 year old male, category B, priority 2 trauma after being struck by a police cruiser
This is a three year old, Spanish speaking only individual with mom also Spanish speaking only, who found at the scene appeared to be struck by front end of a police cruiser moving at low speed. struck in the back, more towards the right rear, just above the right kidney, apparently. Bounced off of the car;there's confusion as to whether he was actually under the car or not under the car. First arriving units found him on the ground held him with a c-spine pending my arrival. He is awake, alert, and oriented, moves all four extremities well, interacts very will with us, perfectly for his age group. When I first found him obviously crying and very upset. Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat are all clear. Has port inviscion because of, nutritional issues, but other than that appears to be patent airway. No exudate from the nose, mouth, or ears. Trachea is midline. Chest is clear and equal bilaterally with no pain on palpation, good spring to the chest as well. No pain that I can tell, no bruising or crepitus throughout the chest wall, and as I said clear and equal bilateral breath sounds, about 22 for his age group. EKT for me is sinus tached 110, 113 over 91 for a pressure. abdomen is soft and non-tender for the front part of the belly. UGI appears to be normal, he is diapered so, because I guess he's three. He is diapered and appears to be constant of bowel and urine at this time. Lower extremities appear to be unremarkable, has some bruises, you know, as a three year old would, in various stages of healing, noting unremarkable, that I would be too concerned about. his back, however, is severely tender. From what I'm gathering as soon as I touch it on the right hand side just above his kidney he actually winces and screams in terrible pain. I do see some bruising just above that right kidney, its started to swell up pretty well, and some redness to it. Nothing really other than that as far as my physical exam is concerned. Pardon me, I do have him immobilized on a pediatric immobilization device. Do have a cuff on him and have him on EKG as well. I'm gonna go ahead and defer the pedi-stick to you guys, I have him resting comfortably, he is no longer crying and appears to be doing pretty well for me. So long as his pressure holds we'll go ahead and do that.
