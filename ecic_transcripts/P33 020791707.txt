A four year old female who was sitting on a wrought iron railing. She lost her balance and fell forward, striking her head on a six to eight inch in diameter PVC piping. right now she's, conscious and lethargic. Mom took her home. It happened over about an hour and 20 minutes ago. She started vomiting and, she was lethargic. We have her fully immobilized at this time. We have a blood pressure of 100 over 60, respirations right now, right about maybe about 14. Clear bilaterally. Pupils are equal and reactive and she does respond to verbal and painful stimuli. She's got a heart rate of about 85 right now. she seems to be just resting. a four year old female patient. Struck head on a PVC pipe one hour ago. They're alert. BP is 100 over 60, respiration's 14, they're bilateral and pleural. Heart rate 85. 
And I haven't noticed any obvious trauma to the four year old but, she does seem... she does seem to be very, lethargic and just kind of out of it right now.
