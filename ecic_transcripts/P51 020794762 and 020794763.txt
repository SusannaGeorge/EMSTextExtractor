A 13 year old and a 2 year old, struck by a car, low speed, 10 miles an hour. already consulted with the local hospital. They prefer that they be seen at the trauma center.
I have 2 female patients. The 13 year old was carrying the 2 year old. Was struck in a parking lot by a small pickup truck at approximately 10 miles an hour. The 13 year old has right hip and right leg pain, no loss of consciousness, alert and oriented. Pink, warm and dry with good lung sounds. And I have a 2 year old who has a lac[eration?] to the forehead. no other deformities are found so far, clear lung sounds, good vitals. Pink, warm and dry. it’s going to take us about, 25 minutes to get down to you. I just wanted to, give you guys a call, give you a heads up with what we have so far. I can give you a call back if I find anything more. we’re still working on assessing and getting the patients packaged. They’re, boarded and collared both right now.
Both, seemed to deny LOC. As far as we know on the two year old…she can’t tell us…but the 13 year old, is unsure but doesn’t believe so. I had, on the 13 year old, a blood pressure of 140 over 80. I had a pulse of around 80. I don’t have a set of vitals just yet on the 2 year old. We’re still, we’re still working on that. They’re being packaged still.
