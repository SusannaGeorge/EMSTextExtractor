Have a seven year old, zero seven year old male, not really sure of the mechanism but, family members seem to think he was riding his scooter. Not clear whether he had a helmet on or not. There was a helmet found, laying on the ground. This probably happened over an hour ago, according to the family. As for the patient, again, not sure what happened, but, he walked inside the house. he is, he’s incontinent with urine, and he’s having trouble recalling the event. family members called 911 and, our services were requested. Patient is alert and oriented. Still doesn’t really remember what happened. he’s fully immobilized on a papoose. He’s got a 20-gauge heplock in the right forearm. Vital signs are: pulse rate of 120, blood pressure of 115 over 77, O-2 stat 98%. He has two goose eggs on the back of his head. That’s the only visible obvious signs of injury.
