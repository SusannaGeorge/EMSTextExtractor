Her mom stated now approximately, 10 to 15 minutes, We don't have a blood pressure cuff small enough to assess a blood pressure on this young lady but we do have a heart rate of 107, and spO2 100%. Her respiration's about 26. she's unable to be aroused at all, appears to be in a deep sleep but is unable to be aroused so we have her fully immobilized and on oxygen via blow by.
